    <h3 >Project 2 : Stock Price Prediction</h3>
    <img src="stockpredictorr.jpg" alt="Project 2 Screenshot" style="width: 400px; height: 200px;">
    <p>A stock predictor uses advanced algorithms, historical data, and other indicators to forecast the future value 
        and movements of stocks or other financial instruments. These predictions, which aim to provide insights for 
        trading and investment, are not guaranteed to be accurate due to the market's inherent complexity and unpredictability. </p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Project 3 : Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
    <img src="Credit_card_fraud_detection_flowchart.jpg" alt="Project 3 Screenshot" style="width: 400px; height: 200px;">
    <p>A credit card fraud predictor is an advanced system, primarily powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), 
        used by financial institutions to analyze transaction data in real-time and identify suspicious activities that may indicate fraud. 
        Instead of relying solely on static, predefined rules, modern fraud predictors leverage vast amounts of historical transaction data 
        to learn and adapt to emerging fraud patterns.</p>
